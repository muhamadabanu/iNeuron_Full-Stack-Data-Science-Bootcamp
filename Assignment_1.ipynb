    "1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "        Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), is all about creating “objects”. An object is a group of interrelated variables and functions. These variables are often referred to as properties of the object and functions are referred to as the behavior of the objects. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",

    "3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "   1. CLASS OBJECT\n",
    "           when we create a class in python then a class object is created so whenever python finds a class statement in the whole program then it creates a class object and assigns a name to that object i.e. class name. As we know in python, everything is an object so the class itself is an object and is the instance of metaclasses. \n",
    "Look at the following example\n",
    "--> class MyClass:\n",
    "--> pass\n",
    "Above code will generate a class object and name it ‘MyClass’. From this class object, we will create instance objects. \n",
    "'Class object inherits the attributes of its parent classes'.\n",
    "   2. INSTANCE OBJECT\n",
    "          when we call a class, it creates an instance object of that class from which the object has been created. \n",
    "For example when we call the above-created class then it will create an instance object like this.\n",
    "--> Obj1=MyClass()\n",
    "The above statement creates an object and names it to Obj1 which is an instance of MyClass. The instance object has access to attributes of the class from which it is created. For example, Obj1 is the instance of class MyClass so, Now Obj1 can access everything defined in the class, and in the class object, we define the default behavior and properties of objects.\n",

In the init method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called."
